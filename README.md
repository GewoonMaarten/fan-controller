# PWM Fan Controller
Arduino fan controller with schematic and pcb. The goal of the project is to create a fan controller that uses a potentiometer as means of controller and a screen as visual output to controller a fan.
In my case I use it to control the fan on my 3D printer, the Cetus3D MKIII.

The PCB was specificly designed for the Cetus3D 3D printer.
